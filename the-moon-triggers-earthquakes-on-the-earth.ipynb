Abstract\n\nInterestingly, it's a very interesting phenomenon that global transformation by a the Moon's tide stress seems to be a trigger of occurrence for a disastrous earthquake (M>=5.5).\n\nIt is found out that some statistically considered research papers geared to past earthquakes, there is no one which show about Lunar Age or Lunar Phase Angle clearly.The one of possibility reason is tidal phase angle on the Earth depends on the lunar age. However, many people can not calculate the tidal phase angle. \n\nThis report's objective is that many people are able to imagine at time of high potential of earthquake occurrence intuitively by using visualization of **the position of the Moon and the Sun when earthquake was occurred**. \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSchuster (1987) [1] is first article which discuss the influence of the tide from the moon.\nSome Studies, such as Tanaka (2012) [2] and Ide et al. (2016) [3], are studied the relationship between the earth tides and earthquakes with targeting specific seismic sources (groups). \nTsuruoka and Ohtake (1995) [4] discussed the relationship with the global tides for earthquakes that occurred in the world. \nHowever, it is too difficult to calclulate tidal stress and to understand it for non-academia ordinary people.\nTherefore, I show some figures of relationship between earthquakes and lunar age in order to imagine the timing of earthquake occurrence. \n\n## 2. Data\n\n## 2.1 Data Source\n\nI selected the \"[Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database)\" as the earthquake catalog to visualize target which is probably presented by USGS (United States Geological Survey) on Kaggle platform.\n\nSome earthquake catalogs (or past event lists) are opend on official sites of public organizations, such as USGS, Meteorological Institute of Japan, Disaster-Reduction Research of Japan. These catalogs are not useful because it is not simple list. \n\nAlmost earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics at each location, regional characteristics exists. This article target for wide-area seismic activity on the whole earth, regional characteristics are not considered at all. Because it makes hard to discuss the actual mechanism of earthquake occurrence, this may be cause a feeling of strangeness to researcher.\n\n## 2.2 Data Overview\n\nLet's confirm a few head data after reading catalog.

Summary\n\nI investigated and visualized the relationship between earthquakes (magnitude >5.5) and the position of both the Moon and the Sun. These results are following:\n\n1. The Moon affects on earthquakes on the Earth strongly like Moonquakes are influenced by the Earth's tidal stress.\n2. The earthquake occurrence increases or decreases according to the phase angle of the Moon and the Sun (lunar age), rather than the distance to the Moon or the Sun.\n3. Earthquakes that are occurred near the equator are more strongly related to phase angle than polar regions.\n4. Annual cycle (seasonal variation) could not be confirmed.\n\nIn addition, following are indicated:\n\n5. Date of earthquake (especially magnitude is higher than 8.0) occurrence tend to full moon or new moon.\n6. Time of earthquake occurrence tend to along about moon rise or moon set (when full moon or new moon, especially)\n\nThis article confines to visualize and mention of trend.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6.
